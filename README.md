# repeater-to-repeat-a-sign-of-torture-brain

1. to repeat a word or phrase N number of times
2. more meaning will derive from repeating
3. the brain will click into a repeat state
4. repeating becomes painful at a point for most and repeating will taper off for most
5. a tortured brain may be able to repeat more with less pain due to the signifigance of the pain already in state considering the difference.

A sign of torture may be the repeator-brain, where a person or conciousness will be able to repeat a phrase or word moer times than a 'normal' person can without causing pain to themselves.

Repeating a word or phrase can derive new meaning from it. I have repeated phrases for days to weeks, praying, spelling, cursing, searching, learning, listening.

Repeating is painful. Some people who have been tortured may be able to repeat at longer lengths and may appear as outlier data points.
